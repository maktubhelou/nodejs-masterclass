# Homework Assignment #3

This app covers the basic functions required of a simple pizza delivery service. Users can create a user ID, create a token which allows them to log in and log out, see the menu, place orders and pay using Stripe. When an order is placed, an e-mail is sent to the user. The user can log in on the front end, set up an account, see the menu, place an order, add to an existing order, and pay for the order. The user receives an e-mail confirming the order.

The emphasis here was not on the front-end, which is pretty basic ;)

## User Stories (Homework Assignment):

1. Signup on the site;
2. View all the items available to order
3. Fill up a shopping cart
4. Place an order (with fake credit card credentials), and receive an email receipt (these are both only set up to work with 4242\*\*\*\* and with markallanevans@gmail.com for testing)
